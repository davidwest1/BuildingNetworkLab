<h1>Building a Network with Cisco Packet Tracer Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project practices network configuration and troubleshooting skills by simulating networks without the need for physical equiptment. I was able create my own network and watch data packets flow across the network. Internet of Things (IoT) and Cybersecurity skills were also practiced in this lab along with the use of Cisco Packet Tracer tool.
